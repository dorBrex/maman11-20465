Hello user, please enter a value for 2 unsigned long values in the next rows.
This program will calculate the similarity of the turned on bits
between the two values and will return to you the number of turned on bits in similar spots in those 2 values 

Please enter a number for x: The number you just entered is: 2730
This number in binary is: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101010101010
Please enter a number for y: The number you just entered is: 10922
This number in binary is: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010101010101010

Starting to count similar turned-on bits...
There are 6 similar turned on bits between x and y binary values!
