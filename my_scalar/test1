Starting the program in order to find the inner product of 2 vectors

Please insert the size (length) of the vector
The vectors's length will be 10

Insert 2 vector's values - insert a number and click enter,
each enter will save the last value you entered in the vector's values, till you reach the limit of values in a vector

Please enter the U vector's values

The values of the U vector are:
2 3 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 
Please enter the V vector's values

The values of the V vector are:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 
Calculating the inner product for U and V vectors

The inner product for U and V vectors is: 181

End of program run
